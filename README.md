### How to use this repo

You could use the "run_analysis.R" to clean the datasets. (But you need to change the work directory to your own work directory.) 

You could refer to "CodeBook.md" to get more details on the description of the variables, the data, and how did I clean the datasets.

You could find the second cleaned data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from "Tidy_Data2.txt".
